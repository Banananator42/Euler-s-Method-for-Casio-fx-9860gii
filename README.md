# Euler-s-Method-for-Casio-fx-9860gii
This is a working version Euler's method that should work on *most* Casio fx-series calculators.

There are two programs included in this repository. 

One version lets you input an end value for t, and the other will loop until you tell it to stop.

I have also included both the raw code so that you can input directly into you calculator and a code package that you can upload to the calculator using the Casio manager software. The software can be found at http://edu.casio.com/softwarelicense/index.php

This code has only been verified to work my Casio fx-9860gii, but it should work on all Casio graphing calculators that have similar designs.
